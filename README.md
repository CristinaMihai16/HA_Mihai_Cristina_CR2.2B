This repository contains Java implementations of various algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

Algorithms Implemented:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Uniform Cost Search
A* Search
