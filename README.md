This repository contains Java implementations of various algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The TSP is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the original city.

Algorithms Implemented:
Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Uniform Cost Search
A* Search

Usage:

Clone the Repository:

git clone <repository_url>

Compile the Code:

Navigate to the project directory and compile the Java source files:

cd TSPSolver
javac *.java

Run the Application:
Execute the Main class to run the TSP solver:

java Main

View Results:
The application will display the best paths found by each algorithm along with their total costs.
